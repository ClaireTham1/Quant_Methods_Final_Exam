## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(interactions)
```

## Read Data
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("exam_data_claire_tham.csv")
```

##Question 1
```{r}
avg_saleschange <- t.test(data$pct_sales_chng)
avg_saleschange
```

We can say with 99% confidence that the true mean sales change is between 3.32 to 4.02 with a sample mean of value 3.67 percentage point increase in sales. On average, sales increased

## Question 2 -> 
Step 1: Sorting the data
```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(100 * count / sum(count))) %>%
arrange(desc(count))
```

Books are the most common type, so the data set will be compared to Books
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(type = as.factor(type)) %>%
  mutate (type = relevel(type, "Books"))
```

Step 2: Run bi variate regression
```{r}
parking_cost_by_type <- lm(parking_cost_change ~ type, data = data)
summary(parking_cost_by_type)
```

Based on the results of the regression, we are 99% confident that parking costs for books stores increased by about 13.6%. Similarly, we can can say for the following (clothing, drug store, furniture, gas station, grocery) with 99% confidence level. Compared to book stores, parking costs for clothing stores decreased an additional 5.7% , parking costs for drugstores decreased by about 4.9%, parking costs furniture stores decreased by 8.2%, parking costs for Gas Stations decreased by about 12.5%, parking costs for Grocery stores decreased by 8.6%. However, we are not confident about the statistical results for restaurants. Even though parking costs for restaurants increased by 2.1% compared to parking costs for books, we are not confident about the statistical results for parking costs for restaurants in comparison to parking costs for book stores.

##Question 3
The effect of distance of transit stops on businesses, controlling for all other variables

```{r}
model_1 <-lm(pct_sales_chng ~ transit_dist + parking_cost_change + lost_parking + bike_chng, data = data)

summary(model_1)
```

For every one mile increase in distance to a transit stop, a store's sale decreased by about 22.4%, holding changes to biking and parking availability constant. This result is statistically significant at 99% confident levels.

## Question 4
```{r}
model_2 <- lm(pct_sales_chng ~ type + transit_dist + parking_cost_change + lost_parking + bike_chng + type:transit_dist, data = data)

summary(model_2)
```
```{r}
interact_plot(model_2, pred = transit_dist, interval = TRUE, modx = type)
```

For each additional mile away from a transit stop, there is a 33.1 percentage point decrease in sales for the base case, the book stores.
For each additional mile away from the transit stop, there is no difference in sales for furniture stalls compared to the base case and it is statistically significant.
For each additional mile away from the transit stop, there is an additional increase of 1.7% in sales for gas stalls compared to the base case and it is statistically significant
For each additional mile away from the transit stop, there is an additional increase of 3.2% in sales for grocery stores compared to the base case and it is statistically significant.

However, the other categories of restaurants, drug stores and clothing stores are not statistically significant.
For each additional mile away from the transit stop, there is an additional decrease of 25.2% in sales for restaurants compared to the base case but it is not statistically significant
For each additional mile away from the transit stop, there is an additional decrease of 28.7% in sales for clothing stores compared to the base case but it is not statistically significant
For each additional mile away from the transit stop, there is an additional decrease of 33.9% in sales for drug stores compared to the base case but it is not statistically significant
